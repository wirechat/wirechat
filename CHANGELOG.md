### Changed
- `NotifyParticipant` channel now uses an encoded type and ID to support mixed models in conversations.

  **Breaking Change:**  
  If you previously listened to the `participant` channel, update to the new format:

  ```diff
  + userId = @js(auth()->id());
  + encodedType = @js(Namu\Wirechat\Helpers\MorphClassResolver::encode(auth()->user()->getMorphClass()));

  - Echo.private(`participant.${userId}`)
  + Echo.private(`participant.${encodedType}.${userId}`)
        .listen('.Namu\\Wirechat\\Events\\NotifyParticipant', (e) => {
           console.log(e);
      });
  ```

- `Folder Structure Reorganized `

  We have restructured the package folders to group related components and assets more logically. This improves view publishing and feature additions. If you have previously published or customized views, please re-publish them using the new command and update any file path references accordingly.


### Fixed  
- Updated tests to fully support conversations with mixed models.  
- Improved participant handling for different models.  

### Updated  
- Optimized code and queries for faster conversation loading.

## [v0.0.7](https://github.com/namumakwembo/wirechat/releases/tag/v0.0.7) - 2024-12-20  
### Added  
- Introduced `Actor` and `Actionable` traits for improved polymorphic relationship handling.  
  - Added tests for `Actor` and `Actionable` traits.

### Fixed  
- Resolved a bug that caused incorrect retrieval of the authenticated participant due to a missing `conversation_id` filter during retrieval.

### Updated  
- Refactored migrations to use `unsignedBigInteger`. All polymorphic relationships now use unsignedBigInteger by default to maintain consistency across databases. This resolves a type mismatch issue found during testing on PostgreSQL.

**Note:** Running `php artisan view:clear` may be required to ensure the changes take effect.
